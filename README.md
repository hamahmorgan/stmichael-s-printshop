St. Michael's Printshop Scheme 

# Governance & Board of Directors

A new mind-st needs to be established. To be on the Board of Directors at St. Michael's is a privledge and an acknowledgment of the committment to community and arts in Newfoundland & Labrador. There needs to be a sense of pride instilled in the Board that is informed with the legacy and vision of St. Michael's Printshop. 

What is our mandate? We need to have a goverance review and write an updated version of our bi-laws. These bi-laws need to be a reflection of where the printshop has been and where it is going. The community's voice should be within the bi-laws and a more nuanced understanding of the printer's association should be developed. 

How do we serve the public and where is our role most important within the communities. Audience - Members - Students. Education is key. Resources are not being used to their full potential. Employees are not able to focus on their strengths, rather they are constantly in catch-up mode in a system that is not working for us, but against us. 

If we were to start a printshop - from scratch, what would it look like? Imagine the potential! 

# Membership 

Right now our membership is limited. We are a resource for only a few - but we can change this. The space has much more to offer with the right programming and advertising. 

Studio Rental, Free Gallery Shows, Visiting Artist Program, Mentorship, Art Sale Discounts, Workshops, Artist Talks, Family Events, etc.

Levels of Membership should include : 1st Time-er, Artist, Collections, Student, Family, and Patron. 
The committment to 8 hours of volunteering for a Membership can be offered as well.
